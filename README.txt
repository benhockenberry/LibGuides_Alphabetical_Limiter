HTML for insertion into a LibGuides "links and lists" box to enable hiding and display based on clicking a letter limiter.  Sample site using it: http://libguides.sjfc.edu/databaselist

Requirements:
As of its publishing, this code will cause all links-and-lists boxes on a page to respond to a click in the same way.  I'd like to make it individual to the selection box, but it wasn't a top priority as I only had one box of this type on the page.
